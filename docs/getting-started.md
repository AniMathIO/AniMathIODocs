# Getting Started with AniMathIO

Let's discover **AniMathIO in less than 5 minutes** - your tool for creating mathematical videos without coding.

## Installation

You can get AniMathIO by downloading it from our official sources.

### Download Options

- **Official Website**: [animathio.com](https://animathio.com)
- **GitHub Releases**: [github.com/AniMathIO/AniMathIO/releases](https://github.com/AniMathIO/AniMathIO/releases)

### Available Versions

- **Windows**: **.exe** installer

  > **Note**: Windows Defender might flag the application as suspicious because we don't have a certificate key yet. This is a false positive, and you can safely proceed with installation.

- **Linux**:

- Graphics card with OpenGL support

## Launch AniMathIO

After installation:

1. Open AniMathIO from your applications menu or desktop shortcut
2. You'll be greeted with the main editor interface
3. Start creating by adding your first mathematical component from the `Mathematical objects` section in the left sidebar

> **Important**: The application will **NOT** automatically save your projects state! Save your work regularly by navigating to the `Export` section in the left sidebar, where you can save as an `.animathio` project or export as a video.

## Your First Project

Let's create a simple animation:

1. Click on `Mathematical objects` section in the left sidebar
2. Select a component from the toolbar (try "Point" to start)
3. Set the width and height of the component
4. Adjust properties such as coordinates type, x and y coordinates
5. You can optionally disable pan and zoom
6. Click on the "Add Element" button to add the component to the canvas
7. Now you can see your component in the canvas, in the media pool and in the timeline as well
8. You can freely move and resize the component to your liking
9. In the timeline, you can set the start and end times of the animation by dragging the start and end handles
10. Click on `Export` section in the left sidebar to save the project as an `.animathio` file or export it as an `.mp4` or `.webm` video file

### Tips for New Users

- Use the **dark/light mode** toggle in the settings to adjust the interface to your preference
- Try the **keyboard shortcuts** for common actions, more details in the settings (available in the latest releases)
- Start with simple components before creating complex animations
- For text with mathematical formulas, use the built-in LaTeX support
- You can use Text-to-Latex feature with a Gemini 2.0 Flash API key, more details about this feature in the settings

Congratulations! You've created your first mathematical visualization with AniMathIO.
